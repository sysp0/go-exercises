# 📚 Go Practice Hub ✨

Welcome to my personal space for learning and practicing the **Go** programming language! 👋

Here, I'm putting together small code snippets, exercises, and experiments as I dive deeper into Go. 🤔

## 🌱 Why This Repo Exists

I created this repository for a few simple reasons:

*   **Track Progress:** To keep a record of my journey learning Go. 📝
*   **Practice Makes Perfect:** To have a dedicated place for coding exercises and examples. 💪
*   **Quick Reference:** So I can easily find and remember how I solved certain problems or used specific Go features. 🧠
*   **Share the Journey:** (If public) To share what I'm learning with others! 😊

## 📁 How Things Are Organized

I'm trying to keep things tidy! The exercises are usually organized into folders based on topics or concepts.

You might find folders like:

*   `basics/` (Hello World, variables, data types)
*   ...and maybe others as I learn more!

Inside each folder, you'll see `.go` files. Each file is typically a small, self-contained exercise or example.

## ✅ What You Need

To run these Go codes on your computer, you just need one thing:

*   **Go Installed:** Make sure you have Go set up on your system. 🛠️
    *   If not, you can get it from the official website: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)
